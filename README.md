BallBot

We introduce BallBot, an autonomous tennis ball collecting robot that allows players to continuously practice their tennis skills while eliminating the inconvenience of collecting all of the balls periodically. Upon activation the system collects tennis balls strewn along a tennis court. Using a camera for data collection and RaspberryPi3 for data processing and analysis, Ballbot is directed to the tennis balls in order to retrieve them.
